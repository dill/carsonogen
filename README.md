# Carson-o-gen

Idea: listen to a random eBird checklist at a given place and time. Sounds from xeno-canto.

Idea source: [Morrison et al (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26488-1)


## To run this

- You need an eBird API key, which you can get [here](https://ebird.org/api/keygen) put that in a plain text file called `ebird_api_key`
- You need a xeno-canto API key, which you get when you register for an account and verify your e-mail address
- You need [`sox`](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) and [`lame`](https://lame.sourceforge.io/)
